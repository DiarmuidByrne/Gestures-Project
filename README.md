# Gestures-Project
***Diarmuid Byrne***

## Purpose of the Application
This Unity game was made as a project for my Gesture-Based UI module. 
The function of the project is to explore cutting edge UI technologies available for 
developing applications that can be used in situations that would have been limiting without them.
For example, this application can be fully utilized without need for keyboard-mouse interaction.  

## Gestures Identified
Using the Myo Armband, a wide range of gestures become available. 
The default gestures that come pre-packaged with the device are:
- Relax arm
- Close fist
- Spread fingers
- Wave in/out
- Pinch (Double tap)
