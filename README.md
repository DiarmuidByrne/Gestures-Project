# Gestures-Project
***Diarmuid Byrne***

## Purpose of the Application
This Unity game was made as a project for my Gesture-Based UI module. 
The function of the project is to explore cutting edge UI technologies available for 
developing applications that can be used in situations that would have been limiting without them.
For example, this application can be fully utilized without need for keyboard-mouse interaction.  

## Gestures Identified
Using the Myo Armband, a wide range of gestures become available. 
The default gestures that come pre-packaged with the device are:
- Relax arm
- Close fist
- Spread fingers
- Wave in/out
- Pinch (Double tap)

## Hardware Used
The Myo armband from Thalmic Labs was used to power this project. From their website, the Myo armband is "a wearable gesture control and motion control device" that allows control of computers, phones and tablets "touch-free".[1]cle 
The Myo uses a mix of accellerometers and muscle sensors to get an accurate reading of the position of your forearm and hand. The hardware is akin to that of the Leap Motion controller, which senses your hand movement. Unlike the Myo though, Leap Motion does not calculate forearm position. This limits any usage to gestures past the wrist. 
However, the Myo is not without its drawbacks, which I have learned in my time with the device. The Motion and gesture detection can be very finicky, and the warmup and calibration times can be inconvenient.
